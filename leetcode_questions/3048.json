{"Id": 3048, "Title": "Earliest Second to Mark Indices I", "Content": "<p>You are given two <strong>1-indexed</strong> integer arrays, <code>nums</code> and, <code>changeIndices</code>, having lengths <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, all indices in <code>nums</code> are unmarked. Your task is to mark <strong>all</strong> indices in <code>nums</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In each second, <code>s</code>, in order from <code>1</code> to <code>m</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>), you can perform <strong>one</strong> of the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Choose an index <code>i</code> in the range <code>[1, n]</code> and <strong>decrement</strong> <code>nums[i]</code> by <code>1</code>.</li>\n\t<li>If <code>nums[changeIndices[s]]</code> is <strong>equal</strong> to <code>0</code>, <strong>mark</strong> the index <code>changeIndices[s]</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>an integer denoting the <strong>earliest second</strong> in the range </em><code>[1, m]</code><em> when <strong>all</strong> indices in </em><code>nums</code><em> can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is impossible.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 8\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, we have 8 seconds.
