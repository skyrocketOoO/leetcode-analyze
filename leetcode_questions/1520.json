{"Id": 1520, "Title": "Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings", "Category": "Algorithms", "Content": "<p>Given a string <code>s</code> of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of <strong>non-empty</strong> substrings of <code>s</code> that meet the following conditions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings <code>s[i..j]</code> and <code>s[x..y]</code>, either <code>j &lt; x</code> or <code>i &gt; y</code> is true.</li>\n\t<li>A substring that contains a certain character <code>c</code> must also contain all occurrences of <code>c</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Find <em>the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions</em>. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, <em>return the one with minimum total length. </em>It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that you can return the substrings in <strong>any</strong> order.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;adefaddaccc&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;]\n<b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:\n[\n&nbsp; &quot;adefaddaccc&quot;\n&nbsp; &quot;adefadda&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;ef&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;e&quot;,\n  &quot;f&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;ccc&quot;,\n]\nIf we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we&#39;d get only 1. If we choose &quot;adefadda&quot;, we are left with &quot;ccc&quot; which is the only one that doesn&#39;t overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it&#39;s not optimal to choose &quot;ef&quot; since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abbaccd&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;d&quot;,&quot;bb&quot;,&quot;cc&quot;]\n<b>Explanation: </b>Notice that while the set of substrings [&quot;d&quot;,&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;cc&quot;] also has length 3, it&#39;s considered incorrect since it has larger total length.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>s</code> contains only lowercase English letters.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Topics": ["String", "Greedy"]}
