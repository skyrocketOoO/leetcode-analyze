{"Id": 3175, "Title": "Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row", "Category": "Algorithms", "Content": "<p>A competition consists of <code>n</code> players numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You are given an integer array <code>skills</code> of size <code>n</code> and a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>k</code>, where <code>skills[i]</code> is the skill level of player <code>i</code>.
