The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> video on a platform was created by <code>creators[i]</code>, has an id of <code>ids[i]</code>, and has <code>views[i]</code> views.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>popularity</strong> of a creator is the <strong>sum</strong> of the number of views on <strong>all</strong> of the creator&#39;s videos.
