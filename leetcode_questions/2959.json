{"Id": 2959, "Title": "Number of Possible Sets of Closing Branches", "Content": "<p>There is a company with <code>n</code> branches across the country, some of which are connected by roads. Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.</p>\n\n<p>The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (<strong>possibly none</strong>). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most <code>maxDistance</code> from each other.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>distance</strong> between two branches is the <strong>minimum</strong> total traveled length needed to reach one branch from another.</p>\n\n<p>You are given integers <code>n</code>, <code>maxDistance</code>, and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D array <code>roads</code>, where <code>roads[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <strong>undirected</strong> road between branches <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with length <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most </em><code>maxDistance</code><em> from any other</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected to it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that, multiple roads are allowed.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/08/example11.png\" style=\"width: 221px; height: 191px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,2],[1,2,10],[0,2,10]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The possible sets of closing branches are:\n- The set [2], after closing, active branches are [0,1] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.\n- The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].\n- The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].\n- The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].\n- The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.\nIt can be proven, that there are only 5 possible sets of closing branches.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/08/example22.png\" style=\"width: 221px; height: 241px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,20],[0,1,10],[1,2,2],[0,2,2]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The possible sets of closing branches are:\n- The set [], after closing, active branches are [0,1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 4.\n- The set [0], after closing, active branches are [1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.\n- The set [1], after closing, active branches are [0,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.\n- The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].\n- The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].\n- The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].\n- The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.\nIt can be proven, that there are only 7 possible sets of closing branches.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, maxDistance = 10, roads = []\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The possible sets of closing branches are:\n- The set [], after closing, the active branch is [0].\n- The set [0], after closing, there are no active branches.\nIt can be proven, that there are only 2 possible sets of closing branches.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= maxDistance &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= roads.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>roads[i].length == 3</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> &lt;= n - 1</code></li>\n\t<li><code>u<sub>i</sub> != v<sub>i</sub></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= w<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li>All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Topics": ["Bit Manipulation", "Graph", "Heap (Priority Queue)", "Enumeration", "Shortest Path"]}
