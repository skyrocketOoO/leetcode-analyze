Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;cababac&quot;.\nAt the 2nd second, we remove characters &quot;cab&quot; from the prefix of word, and add &quot;aba&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;abacaba&quot; and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abacaba&quot;, k = 4\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> At the 1st second, we remove characters &quot;abac&quot; from the prefix of word, and add characters &quot;caba&quot; to the end of word.
