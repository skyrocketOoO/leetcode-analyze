{"Id": 2002, "Title": "Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences", "Category": "Algorithms", "Content": "<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, find two <strong>disjoint palindromic subsequences</strong> of <code>s</code> such that the <strong>product</strong> of their lengths is <strong>maximized</strong>. The two subsequences are <strong>disjoint</strong> if they do not both pick a character at the same index.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> possible <strong>product</strong> of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
