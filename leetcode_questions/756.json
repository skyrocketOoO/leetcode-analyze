{"Id": 756, "Title": "Pyramid Transition Matrix", "Category": "Algorithms", "Content": "<p>You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains <strong>one less block</strong> than the row beneath it and is centered on top.</p>\n\n<p>To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific <strong>triangular patterns</strong> that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a <strong>single block</strong> stacked on top of <strong>two blocks</strong>. The patterns are given&nbsp;as a list of&nbsp;three-letter strings <code>allowed</code>, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, <code>&quot;ABC&quot;</code> represents a triangular pattern with a <code>&#39;C&#39;</code> block stacked on top of an <code>&#39;A&#39;</code> (left) and <code>&#39;B&#39;</code> (right) block. Note that this is different from <code>&quot;BAC&quot;</code> where <code>&#39;B&#39;</code> is on the left bottom and <code>&#39;A&#39;</code> is on the right bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You start with a bottom row of blocks <code>bottom</code>, given as a single string, that you <strong>must</strong> use as the base of the pyramid.</p>\n\n<p>Given <code>bottom</code> and <code>allowed</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that <strong>every triangular pattern</strong> in the pyramid is in </em><code>allowed</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/26/pyramid1-grid.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 232px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> bottom = &quot;BCD&quot;, allowed = [&quot;BCC&quot;,&quot;CDE&quot;,&quot;CEA&quot;,&quot;FFF&quot;]\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.\nStarting from the bottom (level 3), we can build &quot;CE&quot; on level 2 and then build &quot;A&quot; on level 1.\nThere are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are &quot;BCC&quot;, &quot;CDE&quot;, and &quot;CEA&quot;.
