{"Id": 853, "Title": "Car Fleet", "Content": "<p>There are <code>n</code> cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile <code>target</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You are given two integer array <code>position</code> and <code>speed</code>, both of length <code>n</code>, where <code>position[i]</code> is the starting mile of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car and <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car in miles per hour.</p>\n\n<p>A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>car fleet</strong> is a car or cars driving next to each other.
